- 👋 Hi, I’m @when-lambo
- 👀 I’m interested in working with developers that can help realise my ideas for different blockchain projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python - it's a start, but I am really here to meet people that have experience and can work with me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain projects - I manage the ideas and business side of things and let coders do what coders do best - CODE!
